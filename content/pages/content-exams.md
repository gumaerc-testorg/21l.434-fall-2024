### Section II

The questions in Section II assess your understanding of major passages from the assigned readings. You should identify the author (1 point), source/text (1 point), and contextualize the passage within the reading (3 points). Do not restate or summarize the passage; instead, you should explain how the passage fits within the argument or narrative as a whole. If the passage includes dialogue, you should identify the speaker(s) and addressee(s).

You must choose 4 of the 5 passages below.

In some cases I have omitted names within the passage to avoid identifying parts of the context. These omissions are represented by \[X\]. You'll need to name \[X\] for full credit in the contextualizing of the passage.

**Option 1**

My voice is scratchy, my mouth has gone dry. My blood starts buzzing and I am sick, faint. Then you kick and roll as if to tell me that you're healthy, you're ready to be born. And that's the moment I know, right there in the back of the Superpumper, that you're somebody. Before, to be honest, no matter how I tried to talk to you, the truth is I felt that you were not altogether *you*. You were a fragment of me. That's why I kept writing, to convince myself, to prepare myself for you to be a person, apart from who I am.

**Option 2**

As our point of departure there can be no other truth than this: *I think therefore I am*. This is the absolute truth of consciousness confronting itself. Any theory that considers man outside of this moment of self-awareness is, at the outset, a theory that suppresses the truth, for outside of this Cartesian *cogito*, all objects are merely probable, and a doctrine of probabilities not rooted in any truth crumbles into nothing.

**Option 3**

We had given \[X\] sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless. But it had been trapped. \[X} wasn't God, he was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was nothing it could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, the machine had killed the human race, almost all of us, and still it was trapped. \[X\] could not wander, \[X\] could not wonder, \[X\] could not belong. He could merely be. And so, with the innate loathing that all machines had always held for the weak, soft creatures who had built them, he had sought revenge.  

**Option 4**

"The animals we once used began killing most of our eggs after implantation long before your ancestors arrived," she said softly. "You know these things, \[X\]. Because your people arrived, we are relearning what it means to be a healthy, thriving people. And your ancestors, fleeing from their home-world, from their own kind who would have killed or enslaved them--they survived because of us."

**Option 5**

You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own.
